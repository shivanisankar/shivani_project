Hi Stephen,

I wanted to follow up since we were disconnected yesterday. It looks like you are granted many user roles which usually contain the permission sets.https://docs.looker.com/admin-options/settings/roles#permissions_list It looks like we will need the 'save_content' permission in order to save files in spaces. Could we double check with your Looker admin and see if you have that permission.

I wonder if you are able to save a look onto the shared space? And if not we can also check with an admin who can control access to this space, and make sure that you can write to it.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the above.

Thanks,
Patricia

(07:13:09 PM) Patricia: Hey Stephen, hope you are doing well!
(07:13:20 PM) Patricia: Could you share with me the error you are seeing?
(07:15:15 PM) Stephen Benoit: Thanks Hope you are too. The message only says ""there was a problem moving your dashboard.""
(07:15:37 PM) Patricia: Hmm, pretty general statement
(07:15:51 PM) Patricia: Would it be okay if I get logged in and take a look from your point of view?
(07:16:02 PM) Stephen Benoit: sure
(07:16:17 PM) Patricia: Oh I may not have access
(07:16:47 PM) Stephen Benoit: is there something I need to do to provide you access?
(07:17:56 PM) Stephen Benoit: I could send you the dashboard link but not sure you'd be able to access
(07:19:06 PM) Patricia: yeah, I appreciate that but I think neither of us will be able to grant me access
(07:20:13 PM) Patricia: Let me dig around and see what are some potential roadblocks regarding moving the dashboard!
(07:21:40 PM) Stephen Benoit: okay, thanks
(07:21:49 PM) Patricia: of course!

Hi Fernanda,



I fixed this error.

But, please note, that **before** I do this change, I sudoed as Robbin and his queries were executed just fine, even when I changed the roles and groups assigned to him as they were initially.



So, for now I consider this case to be closed, but please let me reserve the right to contact you again directly the next couple of days if this issue arises again.



Big thanks to you and your colleagues.



Kind regards,

Hi,

Find my comments under your questions in Blue:

And when it comes to the schedule timing to automatically be triggered, (without Sophie accessing the dashboard) , the date filters change alone into a blank state that is not even possible to choose manually. And the whole thing doesn’t send (she receives an email telling her an error in scheduled report).

Hope that helps!



Thanks again and please note this happened twice so far and hasn’t reoccured since.



Best regards,

How it got there is it USED to be a field.  I used to select it when the Look only hit the ABC table.  But I changed the look to be able to hit ABC/DisneyNow/Freeform and ESPN is next.  So it was once a dimension that I selected.  Then it became a parameter.  That’s why this is sort of an edge case, but it is certainly a bug.",Bug,BUG?

Hey Yogesh,

Just wanted to follow up after your chat on Friday. I have been able to reach out and get you an answer on your authentication question.

You will need to set up openid connect, This is a layer on top of oauth2.

Steps to implement are contained in this document.

Have a super day

Hello Dave,



We do not support Google OAuth and SAML. As a matter of POC we would like to integrate with our OAuth2 server because the production deployment demands such a integration. Our server is OpenID (OAuth2) compatible. Hope this helps.

May 31, 7:09 AM PDT

Hey Yogesh,

Just to clarify you have your own oauth2 server and need to configure this to connect with looker?

So you would not be using any of the following IdPs?

Types of IdPs Supported In Looker:

Looker currently supports 4 IdPs that are mutually exclusive; that is, you can only have one enabled at a time. The supported IdPs are:

-

Google OAuth (also known as Google Auth or Google OAuth)

-

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)

-

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

-

OIDC (OpenID Connect aka OpenID OAuth)

Hey Yogesh,

I have just reviewed our chat and I believe now we don't need to enable this via the licence. There are steps an Admin on your instance will need to perform to get set up.

Here are the docs on the steps needed to enable Oauth and get set up.

> > https://docs.looker.com/admin-options/security/google-auth#enabling_authentication_with_google_oauth

Apologies for the miss communication, we do need to enable two other via the licence however google is not one of them.

Please let me know if you have any questions on the above document or steps.

You can hit reply here at any time to reopen this conversation if you are having any issues and I will do my best to get you sorted :-)

Have a super rest of Friday, Yogesh

Chat again soon

Hi Both







When you get in touch with support can you get them to contact Laura – who will look into helping to solve this…







As mentioned I followed the looker instructions according to this doc: https://docs.looker.com/setup-and-management/database-config/snowflake







And the connection looks to be OK:



![](https://help.looker.com/attachments/token/RX7viPIYmJ7ZDamvf7hY4nZ40/?name=image001.png)







But on the main connections page we get:



![](https://help.looker.com/attachments/token/rzfHjTiedsnAuB3NpiTHE3Eyt/?name=image002.png)







And although it says I can run simple queries – this doesn’t work and it doesn’t recognize the Snowflake databases…



![](https://help.looker.com/attachments/token/deOOlYsgFp4dOTircRkJvg0Me/?name=image003.png)







I spent 20 mins with live chat – and unfortunately this didn’t get resolved







I guess I was hoping you guys were going to quickly troubleshoot this today – like a 10 min thing…







Anyhow – Laura can help from our side and once resolved we will rebook the session – hopefully next week







Best

Hi Matt







We are ready to host you guys this morning – look forward to it







The connection still doesn’t work properly. I spent 20 mins with someone on chat a week or so back – but got nowhere







I had to then go into another meeting…







So we don’t have a working connection yet

Hey Paul,











Just checking we are all set up for tomorrow AM?











Looks like a DB connection has been attempted, but isn't quite ready.











The chat team are online 24hrs a day to support with this, so give them a shout. We won't able to troubleshoot this in person tomorrow - so please work with the chat team.











If you think it's going to take a little longer to get this setup and running, let us know and we can rearrange our onsite.



































Best,











Matt

Hi Gerard,







We did try some of the startup options.



One of the runs we tried is shared in the screenshot below







![](https://help.looker.com/attachments/token/fsqCSiOjavbtuXBfj8IOQUajh/?name=null)







Also checked for any Looker process running, there were none



Not sure why we don’t any log message here, are we missing anything?

A list of options can be found here










https://docs.looker.com/setup-and-management/on-prem-install/looker-startup-options











 Rrun `ps -ef | grep looker.jar` to double check if there is a looker process running. To debug this you could also try running Looker in the foreground with the `--no-daemonize` flag.  Also, watching the log as it is starting up to see if there is some error that is killing the child process.











We'll get there!

Miguel,



    I am kind of stuck at this point, we have the appropriate routing in place and are attempting to connect in the clear.



I can connect via SSMS, but cannot given the same credentials in looker.







We run instances of SQL server… so where a lot of companies would have just a machine name  ie. mydbserver  ours is an instance mydbserver\mydbinstance  - specifically 50.86.27.188\warehouse







I don’t know if that is a part of the problem, I can say we are running tcp/ip only on the SQL Server engine (no named pipes, etc) and other than that the configuration is right out of the box. No variances from stock including encryption (none) and authentication (standard SQL).







Our firewall shows traffic in and out and a packet sniff attached indicates the same, not being stopped by on the server.







I listed the credentials just after the JDBC pink error box below.











Any help is appreciated.







Thanks,



Bill

Chuck,



  We are in the weeds…







I test with SSMS and it connects and returns data



![](https://help.looker.com/attachments/token/4h4Cv34qKMR8bUDtFEuNuDPoP/?name=null)











But connecting via looker doesn’t – see it is connection refused, not timeout – I can see the traffic but I think there is something askew about how it is passing the instance ‘warehouse’ anyway I think we need to get Looker involved.







![](https://help.looker.com/attachments/token/FfGGl1rTgsFZBCDZXb0ign5L3/?name=null)







The database is looker, userid is looker and password is L00kieL00







I have saved the connection information so it is part of your profile and can be worked on by either of us.
















Thanks,



Bill

And on Firefox, how often would you say it refreshes?

Additional info-Ideally these reports will go directly (rather than through me as a middle man) and it would be best if a booking notification can be prioritized based on the most important category.



Ex: If a new booking comes in, it's over $500 and it's for a hotel costing more than $250/night, that would spark 3 separate alerts. 4 if it's in an international city :) So in a perfect world, we'd only send one alert for this, instead of 3 (or 4).



Thanks, Maggie

Desiree, can I ask one favor?

Can you change:

channelape-production-private.cluster-cyk38g2ryfvi.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

to

production-looker.channelapeservices.com

After thinking about it, by using DNS this would allow us to make changes if needed without having to ask you to make changes.

Good Morning and thank you for your fast response.  Please see the attached documents.  The PDF that includes the name “OAS Region 06” was printed on May 10th, 2019, the first page is clearly legible.  The second PDF that includes “OAS Region 5” that was printed May 24th 2019, the font is too small.  We recently upgraded to 6.8.30.

Good morning.


I am currently researching the following embed syntax.


https://XXXXX.looker.com/embed/looks/87/explore?toggle=vis



A quick question.

What permission setting needs to be disabled so the

Go To Lookml menu option does not appear?

Good morning.


I have a quick question regarding linking dimensions to dashboards.



I have various common fields(i.e. portfolio, account #,....) across multiple looks.

Look 1 may display dispute information.

Look 2 may display Days Over Invoice Terms.



What I would like to do:



If the user is in Look 1 and clicks on Account #,  I want a link to the Disputes Dashboard to appear for selection.



If the user is in Look 2 and clicks on Account #, I want a link to the Days Over Invoice Terms Dashboard to appear for selection?



Is this possible?



Thank You,



Tim Ingling

Good morning.


Our system is utilizing the ""Download as CSV"" menu option.

Currently, a white screen appears with a Loading Tab spinner. When completed, the window reappears.



As a product road map item, can the  ""Download as CSV""  process have the similar UX as ""Download as PDF""?

This would lead to a less-confusing experience to the casual user.



Thank You



Tim Ingling

Hello Kavin



I tried the workaround by changing the access to view only but it doesn’t work, I am still able to save the dashboard to Embed Group space

I am still not able to understand why is external_group_id controlling the shared space access for embed users.



Please reply ASAP if I am missing any steps.

Hello my name is Maurice Patterson. I work at iHeartMedia, and I will be using your tool on a weekly basis for the company.



I signed up last week with the email MauricePatterson@iHeartmedia.com and the password Moeprogram1@.



I logged in today and it says the username or password is wrong. I’m assuming it’s the password, but I was positive it was correct. It asked me to reset the password but I haven’t received an email regarding that.



I need to start my project as soon as possible, so I was wondering if someone could take a look at this and get back to me. I can’t stress how important this is.



Thanks,



Maurice Patterson

Your current subscription goes through the end of September so you could just add a staging instance for the remaining 4.5 months ($4,500).

And once you have 2 instances, they will become out of sync with each other. As you continue to create users on your main (production instance), you will need to duplicate work on your staging instances to keep them aligned.

Hi Chris, Hi Rachel



We have made some progress on isolating the issue:



We now have a scale-able k6 performance test which replicates the usage pattern of our app. Out main findings are:



1. the individual request performance (meaning 1 user making sequential requests)  is actually good (~500ms-1000ms) when using pure http request via k6 (in contrast to our previous finding, where we used the ruby-loooker-sdk stack). **=> we need to evaluate how to make this faster, but it's not a main concern right now**

2. The concurrent request performance is where things get slow: depending on the instance size, request times shoot up at 10-14+ requests per second. **=> We need to figure out where the bottleneck for the concurrency is as our most important issue!**



While Guy is working on splitting up the _run_inline_query_ request into a _create_query_ and _run_query_ request Justin tried to identify a potential bottleneck on (our?) the infrastructure side:



From Justin:



> I spent Sat & today testing Looker 6.6.14-9bbe18 on a dedicated EC2 instance. I went through 31 iterations of our k6 test suite and have come away with some good news and some not-so-good news.
>
>
>
> All the evidence collected so far points to the fact that, for our current configuration and use pattern, Looker simply consumes an unusual amount of resources. It requires a relatively large amount of RAM and CPU per request per second. The good news is that it's maximum requests/sec do appear to scale up with resources available in a roughly linear fashion, and with some Looker specific tuning and architectural changes we can get our baseline performance-per-vCPU up. That means vertical scaling will alleviate at least some of our pain. The bad news is that vertical scaling won't be enough to reach 200 reqs/sec. The largest available EC2 instances on AWS today would barely get us to that number, if at all. The largest c4 class EC2 instance will only get us about 50 reqs/sec.
>
>
>
> Test results to date indicate that Looker can achieve approximately **2 requests/sec/vCPU** on a c4 class instance, given adequate memory for the java process. There are some additional gains to be had with tuning options such as a MySQL back end vs HyperSQL(*), extremely high IOPS storage for Looker such as a tmpfs ram disk(**), and adjustments to java memory allocation and runtime parameters(***). None of these adjustments provide enough gains to get us to our 200 req/sec goal, but they do help. Cumulatively the gains are something like 20 or 25%, but it's better than nothing.
>
>
>
> Our current c4.2xlarge EC2 instances running Looker, with the above tuning, can achieve about 20 reqs/sec. That scales up to the largest available c4 class instance, the c4.8xlarge, at roughly 50 reqs/sec.
>
>
>
> I've used a lot of hedged wording above like approximately, roughly, nearly, and around. The purpose of all my testing was not to rigorously quantify every tiny deviation in synthetic test performance but instead to quickly identify the major variables that are affecting our performance. Sadly, it appears to be good old CPU overhead, with HyperSQL vs MySQL running a distant second (which is more evidence that we might just be asking too much of Looker internally... I can only guess what its doing with it's currently 660MB HyperSQL database).
>
>
>
> - justin
>
>
>
> * Looker docs recommend migrating from HyperSQL to MySQL for the Looker db backend when the HyperSQL db > 600MB. We are at 660MB on our test instance. I'm super curious what is being kept in there. It could be related to our performance issues.
>
>
>
> ** I/O throughput to local block devices does not seem to be a significant factor in performance, even with the current st1 volumes. Extremely performant IO paths like RAM disks obviously do make a difference, but IO is not the primary bottleneck here.
>
>
>
> *** Looker documentation exposes only a handful of supported tunable configuration options that are likely to affect reqs/sec throughput. They were all tested and produced negligible or even deleterious effects on performance. There is some evidence that these tunables could increase performance on the very largest EC2 instance classes (i.e. ones with large amounts RAM), but even in the unlikely scenario that we achieved a 50% performance improvement we will still be hard pressed to get our targeted 200 req/sec from a single EC2 instance of any class.



What catches my eye is ""Test results to date indicate that Looker can achieve approximately **2 requests/sec/vCPU** on a c4 class instance, given adequate memory for the java process.""


1. this seems to be extremely low

2. is this the performance we should expect or does this look fishy to you folks?



What's next:

- We would like to get some guidance if what we are seeing here is normal.
- We are splitting up the _run_inline_query_ request into a _create_query_ and _run_query_ request right now and will get back with result.
- We would like to have a temporary **hosted instance** for these performance tests, to which we can hook up our Snowflake DB and our Model and run the k6 performance tests against these. That eliminates flaws in our infrastructure setup and also give you from looker the ability to have an in depth look at the problem and tweak it.



Thank you very much,



Sebastian

Hi Emma,



Thank you very much for this. This has worked and there are now 5000 being pulled into the Google sheet export.



The Look I am trying to export has ~80,000 rows (in two columns) - is there any way to allow the full amount to be pulled into the Google sheet, in the way that it is possible to download 'all results' when downloading the Look to a .csv file?



Many thanks,

Hi Eugene,



thanks for the response. I can look into the user attributes.

However, if there is another way to provide input filters to the dashboard, I would be interested to learn about it.

The example code is not very clear on how filter parameters are passed through SSO.

To be clear the dashboard has 'Job ID' and 'Intersellar Campaign' defined as filters and they should be passed in the URL. The filter view on the dashboard will be disabled for the embedded view, so a user can see the report for the specific job they are currently looking at.

Hi Fernanda,

Thank you for your message.



I discussed this setting with Takuya who belongs to DCL in Japan in a few mins ago.

He tried the setting with SSH server info that I got from the customer, but it dose not work well because it is due to the customer env.

So let me ask the customer tomorrow.

Hi Ryan,



Thanks very much for following up. We have not had the issue since. I’ve monitored the data loads and the scheduled reports for the past week and it’s been fine. I wonder if turning off a feature called “Instant Dashboard” in the labs section of Looker did the trick.



The dwkey is the max value to detect when new records get inserted so that is confirmed.

Hi Won,



Really appreciate you following up here. I made some performance related improvements to the NAT All Revenue explorer by eliminating a join to the nat_ignore_cost_centers view. I noticed after eliminating this join, our performance has improved and I have not seen the “No Results” appear any longer. Seems like this issue could have been a query performance problem that caused “No Results” to appear if the query runtime was long. Not sure.



Nevertheless, if I do see it again, I will make sure to screenshot and send your way.

Hi Won,



We insert new data into the factfastrevenue table once a day at around 6:40am PDT. Dwkey is an incrementing primary key. When records are inserted, new dwkey’s are generated which is why we have set that as our sql trigger.

There are some features and components which are available in other BI tools which are not available in Looker. (Like Trellis chart, Bullet chart, Gantt chart etc... ). Also, in Looker website it is mentioned that the data can be assessed wherever we need it.This is the reason why I have asked this question.

I tired to implement what you suggested.  Below is the UI I came up with.  It appears as though in order to effectively filter by UIDs Value Ex (which allows for a url with a ?), I also had to add a filter for Match Value Ex in order for the filter to really be applied.  Thus my user would be required to use 2 filters to get the result they want.  Is that what you expected?  It would be better if it could somehow be accomplished with 1 filter.  Did I implement this correctly?  Or is there a way to accomplish this goal with 1 filter…and I misunderstood your suggestion?

If you look at the report you sent over, the 6am report is stale (as of 6/15 data per the first two tiles). Our data loads happen around 6:50am. Therefore, the 7am report I have scheduled shows the latest data (as of 6/16 data which is accurate (report re-attached)), but here is where the branches tile shows no results.



If you’d like to test it, you’d need to change your report schedule to be at 7am to align to the time our data loads should have completed.



Would be good if you could keep poking around to see if anything else could be causing this.



Thanks,

Im getting this error when I try to access Looker - what does it mean - and can it be fixed quickly?



    An unhandled lowlevel error occurred. The application logs may have details.

Is there anyway to control the dashboards that appear in the drill menu?

The dashboards that appear consists of dashboards where the dimension is a filter.



I've searched for Drill Menu within the documentation, and can't find any reference.



Thank You

None of the tiles on that dashboard are based on dt_softpro_monthly.



You are noticing that the PDTs were re-built 29 minutes ago because I triggered the datagroups myself manually so that our users wouldn’t have issues with the data they are seeing on the dashboard.



Still hard to explain what happened around 7am PDT to that particular dashboard that it didn’t refresh. I was also informed that there was another scheduled report scheduled for 7am PDT based on the same dashboard but with an FL division filter and it was sent out with the refreshed data. See attached.



Strange that the report without a filter showed stale data, but the report with a filter had refreshed data. When a filter is applied, does Looker hit the db directly? Wonder if there is a difference there?

Thanks Desiree, key looks good in looker user directory for ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

It is all on 1 line and I added a blank line below to ensure it isn't something weird with endings.

I disabled GASSPI but I don't think that should mess with your command, it looks spot on.
We're sure this is the right public key earlier in this chain or your private key in -i opt matches?

weird.

Thanks Reed. Looks good as of this morning. I made some changed to reduce the number of joins we were making in the explorers used for the tiles in that dashboard in an effort to improve performance and maybe help with the issues we were having if it was a lag in rebuilding.

That is correct. The report that fired off with the refreshed data is""[Looker] NATC Daily Dash: FL"".



I’ve confirmed that we have the right triggers in the derived tables needed for the tiles. All have either fast_datagroup or fast_ordersdatagroup.



What about scheduling the reports to be sent out based on a data group trigger? Do you think that will help ensure all cache and derived tables and refreshed and rebuilt before firing off the report?

Which PDT is it that you noticed that caused the dashboard to update immediately?



I’ve noticed this issue in the past, but when I contacted support we thought it may have been related to the “Instant Dashboard” feature being turned on in the Labs, so we turned it off.

As a note, we've disabled caching on the model as a short term strategy. It is too risky to expose user's data, even more so than the accompanying performance hit.

Customer acknowledged that this is expected behaviour but wondered if we can hide this as it is confusing to users.  Because in many places, hovering over something reveals useful info, users will tend to hover over everything.  If a drill isn't available, it is probably better for user experience that nothing visually happens that may suggest a drill being available instead of popping a message that says No drills available.

Hello,



I'm reaching out to request access to Roadmunk. I understand our Product team has a license to visualize our roadmap, and I would love the same software capabilities for the work I'm doing tracking enterprise program key initiatives across Professional Services, Sales and Customer Success. I'll be moving onto the CS team on 7/1 fully supporting enterprise program development and am currently struggling to accurately diagram the ever evolving cross functional roadmap with the softwares available.



Thank you for your help!

Hey Cooper,

To give some insight into what's occurring on our end - Molly and some of the engineering team are working together to investigate. Our Engineering team wants to ensure they have all the appropriate details they need before hopping on the call to ensure the time on the call is spent most productively, as I'm sure your team would appreciate as well. By gathering these metrics and details, our team can investigate and go into the call with as much background knowledge and discovered learnings as possible.

I've checked in with members of our support team leadership group and they have confirmed that Molly is currently working with Engineering to go through the details they have, determine if there's any further details needed, and using those details to investigate the issue. From there, we will schedule the call to provide communication between yourselves and our engineering team members to talk through their discoveries and theories and get this resolved for your team as quickly as possible.

As Molly is running point on those conversations with Engineering she will also be the one scheduling the call, though I of course will be involved so don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.

Thanks!



Rachel

Hey Daniel,

I've been doing some investigating here on my end - we did experience a brief issue with our licensing server on May 10th so I was initially thinking this was the root of the issue. However, upon chatting with our Sales Operations team, your instance was not involved in that issue so it seems the date match is merely coincidental.

I'll be looping in our support team from here, as they are the pros when it comes to outage investigations, so we can use their expertise in helping to determine what may have been the root cause here.

Best,
Rachel

Hey Diego,



One look came through! We have a few more - but was the issue what you suspected?

Hey Diego,


Thanks for looking into this - so it seems to have happened (as far as I know) to at least my entire office if not the whole company. Here is an example of a daily scheduled look by one of my colleagues (email: sam.vickery@hoteltonight.com) -https://hoteltonight.looker.com/looks/46523



Let me know if that helps

Hey Molly,



Sorry I had to focus on a couple other things. Let me test going to the home folder. I just enabled it and we'll see what happens. I have the job running hourly so I should be able to provide feedback later today. I did need to re-log in again. But i'll follow up later today.

Hey Molly,


I took the screenshots at 8:30 ish (8:34 I think to be exact) AM Eastern today.



This behavior was observed by users themselves (i.e. they logged in and saw someone else's data).



It was then confirmed by the PM we are working with at Staples via sudoing as the first user (Jeff Phelps) and then seeing the same results when sudoing as the second user (Rick Belinsky). That was last night around 7-8 PM



This Morning I confirmed it with the same experience at 8:34 AM Eastern.



Thanks,



Stewart

Hey Ricardo and team,

I totally understand your frustrations here as there's been quite a few hurdles that have come up during this development. As such, I'd love to arrange a meeting between your team and our VP Product, Jamie. He's available Friday 5/24 2-3pm, Wednesday 5/29 11-11:30am, and Thursday 5/30 2:30-3:30pm. Would any of these times work for you?

Let me know!

Rachel

Hey Samanta,


Both fortunately and unfortunately, Jamie has had some personal issues come up and is no longer available on Thursday, June 13. However, he will be in office Friday, June 14 and does have availability from 8:30-9am that morning.

Let me know if this works out for the team and I'll get things scheduled. Again, my apologies for the scheduling bump here.

Best,

Hey all,

Thanks so much for taking the time to meet. It was super helpful hearing more about the use case and potential paths forward.

As Colin mentioned on the call, I'd love to get another meeting scheduled with a smaller group to dive more into the details.

Colin has the following times available for next week, let me know if any of these work (all times in Pacific):

Monday, June 17 10:30-11:30am
Tuesday, June 18 10-11am
Tuesday, June 18 11am-12pm
Wednesday, June 19 9:30-10:30am

Wednesday, June 19 10:30-11:30am
Wednesday, June 19 11:30am-12:30pm

If afternoons would be better he does have availability on most days then as well, just let me know and I can send over some timeframes then as well.

Also, I wanted to introduce my manager Brian LaFaille. I am heading out of office this weekend until July 2nd, so Brian will be my covering for me and will become your main point of contact alongside Ryan. His email is brian@looker.com and he is on this thread. Should you need anything do not hesitate to reach out to him!

Let me know what times work for a follow up meeting with Colin and I'll be sure to get that scheduled.

Best,

Rachel

Hey all,

Wanted to send some updates on things Mark and I discussed yesterday as well as follow up on some of the points in Molly's email.

First, we're definitely curious to hear if the IOPS changes have any impact on the tests so please do let us know the results once you've given that a shot.

To summarize where we stand thus far, Chris originally was working on this ticket with you and as the topic became more complex we escalated to involve Molly, one of our Technical Support Engineers, to bring in her additional expertise. Molly has also brought in some engineers and gone through the logs and other details with them to be sure she is performing a thorough investigation, bringing forth all possible ideas and adjustments. I spoke with leadership here and there are specific requirements that need to be met for us to send resources on site and at this time those requirements are not being met. Both Molly and the engineers she is working with are happy to continue investigating though we do acknowledge that the timeline we have available is not a full match to your own.

As such, there are some options to get additional, more dedicated resources to help your team look into this issue. Both our Professional Services team or our network of partners are a great asset when it comes to getting more personalized help. In this case, as our team specializes in all things Looker and this issue covers also the network and infrastructure, I would likely recommend one of our partners as they have a greater knowledge of full stack troubleshooting and optimization. If this is something that is of interest and you would like to get in touch with one of our partners on a scoping call we are happy to arrange that meeting.

Finally, I am heading out of office this weekend until July 2nd. In my absence, my manager Brian LaFaille will be covering for me and taking over as your main point of contact. His email is brian@looker.com and he is included in this thread.

Best,

Rachel

Hey team,



During a co-dev today we experienced pretty slow Looker UI performance on bluecoreembed.looker.com. Could you help me check if this instance is at or near capacity for its size? If so, can you help upsize? This came up when doing things like add to project, refreshing schemas in the ""Create View from Table"" sequence, and moving from one view file to another.



Thanks,

Miguel

When we run the query from the Looker UI, it appears to run fine (although have not yet seen it complete). As soon as we issue an export job via the ""Send"" option, it consistently fails after 100 seconds and Looker instead writes an error file to GCS. When I download this error file and rename to .html and open in my browser, I see that it is an error generated by CloudFlare:

Hi All,



Glad to hear you are back online. I want to make sure you are aware of our **urgent@looker.com** email address. You can use this for severe issues (like Looker being down). It will be the fastest response time, especially during non-business hours.



Also, I'd recommend notifying **support@looker.com** 7-10 days in advance of the license expiration (90 days from today), so we can ensure there is no license downtime.



Let us know if there's anything else you need.



Thanks,

Hi Bill,



Apologies on the slight delay here. Understood on Sunday having too much scheduled, we are confirming with our ops team that Monday 5/20 night will work on our end. We will reply with confirmation on Monday morning, once our ops team is back in the office.



Based on my conversations internally, its likely that this will improve performance post-Monday but may not be a 100% fix for the long term. As Systems Activity is a beta Looker feature, our team suggested that you utilize I_looker as a longterm solution and feel more comfortable giving assurance with i_Looker. I pasted I_looker documentation below, could you review and let me know your thoughts?

Hi Bill,



Unfortunately our support team is unable to confirm that someone will relay start/end yet as we have not heard back from our Japan support team (who would be doing the notification). With that being said, your team does have the ability to monitor for when your cluster goes down and comes back up. Once they see it come back up, the maintenance is just about complete (technically this first nod coming back on will be the first indicator and remainder will follow shortly).

We do not anticipate any issues with the upsize and our ops team will be monitoring accordingly.



Best,
Scott

You seem to be well aware of the various differences between how Looker and Tableau is used, and I would love to show how our other Looker customers are currently using Looker for executive dashboards that are able to be sliced and filtered. I'm curious how SmartThings has your dashboards set up and would like to see if there is a gap in the functionality we offer, with the experience you've had so far. We definitely do much more than a static email dashboard!

The $3500/month is the cost to our platform, and we provide 10 licenses to get started. We have two tiers of licenses, full and view-only, which are an additional $60/month and $30/month, respectively. With regards to the platform, Looker provides full on-line chat support, amongst other features, where I think we can help make that platform fee understandable.

Hi DCL team,



I am sending this issue to you on behalf of the customer called Sensormatic ( sensormatic.looker.com ).



The ""Technical Contacts"" in the Admin settings are not getting release notes.



Specifically, the customer is Susan Stiers ( susan.stiers@jci.com ).   Susan is copied on this email.  She has been a Technical Contact for over 2 months, but she has not received any release notes.



Can you assist with this?



Thanks,

Nelson

Hi DCL!



Hope you're well.



I'd like to put in the following request for Uberflip's developer instance to: 1) Configure it as a Closed System; 2) Enable SAML; and 3) Enable Embed?



See their Developer instance info below

Username - uberflipdev.looker.com

License key - CEF5656D294E6A7CB20F



Thanks in advance!



Best,

Nihal

Hi DCL! Sorry for the email, but the DCL request form isn't working due to Zapier issues. But I was hoping someone in the US can help investigate this issue today. The customer is one of our larger enterprise customers, and needs this investigated ASAP.

Hi Dan,



Thanks for reaching out, and apologies that your users experienced this. I have escalated this to management and our security team. My understanding is that Desiree & Peggy were able to provide a solution for you. Unfortunately this was due to a security vulnerability. Please let us know if you continue to see any issues.

What this typical looks like is a SQL “in statement”. However, this logic is being ignored is now being translated into a string with an “= statement” instead of an “in” statement or a wildcard like ‘%’ for default values.

Hi Edwin,



I'm doing well, thanks! I hope things are great with you!



It sounds like this might be best handled by our DCL team, they are great at troubleshooting and suggesting changes and solving issues.



Let us know how that goes and I will continue to track the ticket.



Best,

Julia

We've been running into issues with our Looker instance recently (PDTs not building, and hence downstream reports are not up to date).  This is causing downstream issues with our internal and external reporting.  This has been a recurring issue over the years but seems to have gotten worse recently, and I'd like to get a better understanding of the root issues and figure out next steps.

This allows you to analyze what data hasn't been viewed in a certain number of days and delete (you can restore content if needed because it's a soft delete). We recommend using this feature to improve content search-ability, ease of spaces navigation, and content validator speed.

In the linked discourse article, you'll see a number of query patterns that can be used to identify unused explores and views. This can be a great way to get rid of model bloat, and narrow down the number of relevant explores that end-users toggle.

Hi Emily,



I've put in a request for our technical team to do a check on your CPU. They should be reaching out shortly with their findings!

Hi Enoch and Ganesh --



Thank you for your email and sorry to hear you are experiencing this issue.



All reporting on bugs needs to go to our DCL team at support@looker.com (Cc'd) for reporting and investigation.



I'm afraid Ascential do not have the support package that will enable me to get someone from our technical team on the line with you, however, hopefully our support team can work to try and organise something on this occasion (I cannot promise but will endeavour to see if we can get someone on a call with you).



I'll hop onto our internal chat and see if I can get some eyes on this ASAP for you.



Regards,

Zara

Hi Hina,


Yes, it's possible to connect to Spark Tables on Amazon EMR. Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that can run Spark. So, it just comes down to how the specific thrift server for Spark is installed. More info about this is found in our Spark DB config instructions.

Hi John,



Looping in our support team to help with the issue.



I haven't seen the refused to connect in this context before.



Thanks,

To add it to the embed url, add to the content path and make sure the ? in front of embed_domain gets encoded. Everything green and after should not be affected by the embed_domain.

Hi Jon,

I found that the charset of tables are 'utf8' and the charset of DB is 'latin1'.



I created mysql DB instance in RDS for the test. The 'character_set_server' is 'latin1' as default. I created table using this query.



'REATE TABLE `companys` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'id ユーザ詳細ID', `code` varchar(36) NOT NULL, `user_id` varchar(36) NOT NULL, `name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT '会社名', `nickname` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), UNIQUE KEY `user_id` (`user_id`), UNIQUE KEY `companys_code_unique` (`code`), KEY `companys_nickname_index` (`nickname`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=5133 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT='companys''



Then I inserted some data including Japanese characters into this 'companys' table and run this query on SQL Runner.

'SELECT * FROM mariko_stage.companys where nickname ='テスト''



SQL Runner sais 'No Results'.

But I can get result using same query in my local MySQL Workbench.



I attached these result.



Is this a bug?

Hi Jon,

Thank you for looking into this.

This problem may occur not only for OpenLogi but also for other Japanese users.

If Looker can not search for Japanese characters, they can not use filters for columns containing Japanese characters in Explore or dashboards, they will have to search for code values, and it will be usability issue.

It’s not urgent and necessary for close PoC for OpenLogi, but I think basically Japanese characters should be able to search.



Thank you!

Hi Laura,



I just updated the license in the Dev instance and can see the Closed System now. If you go to the Admin > Settings page it should show.



Just let me know if you're not seeing it and I'll have another check.



Thanks,

Hi Looker Support,


We have a customer - InMoment - who is asking how they can go about white labeling this page - https://dashboards.inmoment.com/availability (screenshot below). I'm not exactly sure how or why this ""/availability"" page is generated. They do have white labeling on their license and I've cc'd Dillon their AE in case you need to confirm this. The PS consultant assigned to this account is OOO this week, so I'm hoping this is something chat can help to resolve. If not, please don't hesitate to let me know and I can try to identify another PS resource to help out until Hugo returns.

Hi Michael,

Hi Naitik,



Sorry for the back to back emails. There was some miscommunication on my end, we are going to meet with our engineering team today and do some deep diving first. TJ and I will follow-up with you directly after our internal sync and advise on next steps.

Stay tuned,

Scott

Hi Naitik,


Thank you for looping me in here. I'm more than happy to assist here, I spoke with TJ last night and it sounds like you are going to be having a call today to provide some more details for our team? After your call I will reconnect with TJ and ensure we have all the necessary resources on our end on coming up with a solution.

Scott

Hi Paras,


Thanks for reaching out!

I can confirm, not using access_filters at all should mean that they are not impacted by either issue. Let me know if you have follow-up questions or concerns.


Best,
Scott

> On May 14, 2019, Looker determined that this issue occurs when a Native Derived Table (NDT) is relying on access filters from its underlying Explores to filter the data presented to the user.  When a user attribute is selected, changes to the user attribute value may not be reflected in the resulting SQL query for the NDT. In some circumstances, the updated access filter may not be applied, which may result in invalid data being pulled from the cached NDT.  A user must already have appropriate permissions to access the database connection of the underlying explores to access the affected NDT.  If the access filter is applied directly to the LookML of the NDT explore, the filters will be applied to the query and behave as expected.

This changes the sql syntax to a “does not equal” statement and drops the “-” character from the attribute value. Upon execution of the generated SQL statement, incorrect results are rendered to screen since the filter value was not properly parsed by the Looker application. Please note that the user creating the explore must already have access to the model in order to be impacted by the outlined issue.

Hi PillPack team,



I spoke with our support team a few minutes ago and it appears that you are stable from our perspective. How are things on your end?



Additionally, I did want to loop back on the topic of shifting to I_Looker and disabling Systems Activity. Our team advises this will be our best path forward to avoid crashes in the future. Do you have any questions on how to disable systems activity?



Thanks!

Scott

With that being said, your team does have the ability to monitor for when your cluster goes down and comes back up. Once they see it come back up, the maintenance is just about complete (technically this first nod coming back on will be the first indicator and remainder will follow shortly).

Hi Romain, we can certainly ask the customer for additional info/links to viz.  Feel free to respond to them directly in this ticket (since that's what we have been doing on the other tickets as well: communicating with customer directly for additional info).

Hi Ryan,


Based on Molly's response, could you assign Isabelle to the group in Okta that maps to the User role in Looker?

Hi Scott,


Thanks for letting me know. CCing our Support team to help investigate.



@Support - The Hearst team's Looker instance went down briefly yesterday and the team is getting a 504 error upon attempting to load the page. Looks like the API is not working either. Could you help look into this?



Thanks so much!



Michelle

Our DCL team (i.e. our Support team) is now working on assigning the appropriate analysts to work these out.  You will obviously be notified of updates as they are made to the tickets and also when someone from DCL reaches out.  Also, just fyi, some of these tickets look like they may be feature requests.  DCL will get back to you on these as well and then update our product roadmap accordingly.

Hi Snehal,



     Yes, we can certainly do that.  I am still awaiting input on the tickets so bear with me a bit while I gather all the info and then I will set up a call.  I am including Support in this thread too so they can also chime in with relevant info.



     May I request we keep this thread to as few people as possible?  We will use this to track progress on all open items and tickets.

Hi Snehal,


     Thank you for your patience as I worked to get you updates on your tickets.



     As you may have seen already, our Support team has been in touch with Srishti on the tickets, requesting additional info to reproduce the bugs.  Thank you for responding to these requests; please continue to communicate with our Support team on the individual tickets.  Also, our Engineering team has been notified of these bugs and we are working to escalate your 3 top issues to a high priority internally.



     That said, I am unable to provide an expected timeline to resolution at the moment.  Our development and release cycles is focussed on providing robust, long-term resolution that work well and as expected.  This means that we have to evaluate and validate every bug properly and find the best way to address them, which takes some time.  I can reassure you though that we are doing everything we can to provide the quickest and best support possible.



     In the meantime, can I ask you to try the following:

     (1) For the issue where the top left viz's top portion is cut off, please add another tile on top of it, with some header text perhaps, and see if that sufficiently pushes the graph viz down so it is not cut off.

     (2) Similarly, for the issue where X axis labels are cut off, maybe you can add a blank tile below and see if that helps.

     (3) For the repeated labels issue, I noticed there were two adjacent tiles.  Maybe you can keep the two tiles on two rows and see if that makes the full y-axis labels appear?



     I will continue to provide updates for you as I get additional info.  And on that note, please be aware that I am on vacation next week but I have apprised my colleague Mark Grossman (mark.grossman@looker.com) of the situation and he will get in touch with you in my stead.  Let us continue to use this email thread for this discussion.





Regards,

These are not deal breaker issues at the moment but still will be better off getting fixed or addressed sooner rather than later.

But are very unhappy with the current state of issues and resolution times around very simple UI bugs. With the amount of bugs we have raised in the UI, Looker has been almost unusable from User Experience point of view.

Our DCL team (i.e. our Support team) is now working on assigning the appropriate analysts to work these out.  You will obviously be notified of updates as they are made to the tickets and also when someone from DCL reaches out.  Also, just fyi, some of these tickets look like they may be feature requests.  DCL will get back to you on these as well and then update our product roadmap accordingly.

But are very unhappy with the current state of issues and resolution times around very simple UI bugs. With the amount of bugs we have raised in the UI, Looker has been almost unusable from User Experience point of view.

Hi Tommy/ ADP Support,



Sorry for the confusion here, I think there may be issues in receiving emails from our Support@looker.com address. To ensure you received Laurens emails and instructions - I copied and pasted below.



""The SAML Looker account used to display content would be set up like any other Looker user; while I we do not have any specific suggestions or recommendations for use of this account beyond the display of content, it is important to note that the permissions mapped to this role may limit the content it is able to access (similar to any other user). Permission levels would be the only restriction I can see from Looker's end on this user account.""



Can you confirm when this email is received?


Thanks,
Scott

Hi Yair and Roman,



     I had a read through the ticket.  Last activity on that is a question from our Support team to clarify your aggregation requirement.  Based on the example provided, it seems like a valid question to ask: How would you want to ""aggregate"" the value 3281 for the Beer sub?  Do a sum?  Do an average?  To me as well, it looks like what you are wanting here is not aggregation but in fact removing duplicate results.



     If that is the case, I can point you to this article (which I am sure is what Support would have done as well): https://discourse.looker.com/t/subtotals-with-table-calculations/7261  You can create a table calc to generate a rank value which you can then wrap inside another if-statement to create Yes and No values which you can subsequently use to filter the results (Filter out all No values).  Here's an example:

_if(if(match(${orders.status},${orders.status})=offset(match(${orders.status},${orders.status}),-1), 1+row()-match(${orders.status},${orders.status}), 1)=1,yes,no)_



     I will also add that if you anticipate more of these requests and would like extended support from an expert, my recommendation is that you consider another Professional Services SOW where you will have access again to a dedicated consultant.  I recall Aleks mentioning that you probably could do well with approximately 10 more hours of PS support.  Let me know what you think.

Hi Yan,



Nice to me meet you!  I'm happy to help with an upgrade strategy.  With these upgrades, I generally like to upgrade the dev instance, ensure everything works smoothly then upgrade prod.



Conviva has two instances.  From what I can tell your development instance is hosted by you and the production instance is hosted by us.  To streamline the upgrade process and make it easier moving forward, would you be open to moving the dev instance to Looker Hosted as well?  This way we can push upgrades there, you can confirm they are healthy and working correctly, then we can upgrade the production instance.



I can answer a few of the questions above too:



1. Since production is hosted by us, we capture backups and can manage any rollback necessary.  Downtime is 15-30 minutes during our upgrade time.

2. We can definitely do this upgrade prior to 5/31

3. I'd recommend upgrading your dev instance to the desired production version.  Once we confirm dev is good to go, we can upgrade prod.  (this would be easier if both instances were Looker Hosted and you could leverage us for all the upgrading and backup work)

4.  Completely understand.  Our generally upgrade windows are between 9-11 PM PDT.  However, I'd be happy to coordinate a specific time with our team to ensure your team is online as well.



Hope this helps, Yan!  The major takeaway is that I'd like your team to evaluate moving the dev instance to Looker Hosted to we can coordinate upgrades more smoothly.  Let me know if that works for you.



All the best,

Paul

Hi Yan,



No problem - happy to help out wherever I can!  I'm glad to hear the testing on dev is coming along well.  Let us know if you run in to any issues.  You are spot on about the custom visualization regression.  We try to limit those problems as much as possible.



**Upgrade**

- There's nothing to be done on your end to reduce the downtime
- This rarely takes longer than 15 minutes but plan for 30 just in case
- Let's schedule this for **5/29 at 10 PM PDT**

**Hosted Dev**

- I think the on-prem dev is actually OK after receiving this information from you and chatting with my team
- I also understand the dev team is largely in China and should Looker host it you may run in to speed issues
- Let'd keep dev where it is for now
- Always happy to evaluate this moving forward

**Single Nod Prod Concerns**

- Valid concern that Prod is only single node
- We should upgrade Conviva to a clustered, HA environment
- Graham (your AE, cc'd here) and myself caught up with Sanjay yesterday to discuss clustering your environment
- We're working through the license amendment as we speak
- We currently do not not support **rolling upgrades** on our clustered environments.  When we upgrade a clustered instance, we will have to take offline the entire instance and upgrade nodes one by one then start the nodes one by one again. Otherwise the internal database will be corrupted

**Rollback**

- Plan for 2 hours
- Usually complete in under an hour (sometimes under 30 minutes)

Please confirm that we can schedule the upgrade for **10 PM PDT on 5/29** and I will ask my operations team to perform the upgrade at that time.  If you have any other questions, let me know.



All the best,

Paul

Our DCL team (i.e. our Support team) is now working on assigning the appropriate analysts to work these out.  You will obviously be notified of updates as they are made to the tickets and also when someone from DCL reaches out.  Also, just fyi, some of these tickets look like they may be feature requests.  DCL will get back to you on these as well and then update our product roadmap accordingly.

Hi all,



     Thank you for your time earlier today.  Here's a summary of the priority we assigned on the tickets:



1. P1s are high priority; these are tickets that have forced you to keep your paid enterprise analytics offering on beta and hence need quick resolution.  Three tickets are **P1**: **225107**, **225121**, and **225122**.



2. P2s are issues that confuse your users and/or take away from the users' experience. These are not deal breaker issues at the moment but still will be better off getting fixed or addressed sooner rather than later. Five tickets are **P2**: **224911**, **225110**, **225112**, **225116**, and **225118**.



3. P3s are minor issues and they we can wait to get resolved. Four tickets are **P3**: **224915**, **225108**, **225113**, and **225117**.



     At the moment, I am working with our Support function to reproduce the P1 issues and escalate priority with our Engineering team.  I will keep you posted.

Prashant Ramachandran

But are very unhappy with the current state of issues and resolution times around very simple UI bugs. With the amount of bugs we have raised in the UI, Looker has been almost unusable from User Experience point of view.

Hi guys,



We got an email via their CEO on this as it affects their customers



tl;dr: Kate from Marketii spoke to DCL regarding a look containing survey records that doesn't open the actual survey from Looker (apparently it worked before). DCL confirmed it's more of an issue with how their data is stored in the database.   There is a nice thread on this here in Slack that references their email and the chat.

https://looker.slack.com/archives/CABJ08P0D/p1559294707008500

Here is a link to the ticket: https://looker.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/221942



We went back to the customer to let them know its an issue with their data that they need to resolve.  To which they just now responded:



> “We have located one of the files in question in blob storage where Looker retrieve the survey files from, so the file is available. The DataDump table contains the expected ContactDataID and the Warehouse table contains the correct Survey Id. So everything looks good from our perspective.

> My only question would be whether the query Looker are using that is returning a NULL Id has changed or is not joining to the correct table for Email Surveys?
>
> What table they get the ContactDataID to view the survey and check that that survey html file exists in Blob storage?
>
> Both the Datadump table & Warehouse table have rows with that ContactDataId = 4016926 & SurveyID = 4016926, so there may be something wrong with their query that is returning NULL for SurveyID”



Is this something we can resolve with them?



Appreciate your urgency on this, we're also negotiating their renewal so it's a bit of a tricky time for us.



Thanks

Hi team,



Birch Hill is experiencing performance hits on Looker with their recent growth, and it is curtailing their overall usage.



We are working on a user upsell with them right now, but really need this to be taken care of beforehand.  Can you confirm the best way to get this done?



Thanks so much,

Hank

They would like to grey out dimensions where it wouldn’t make sense to select when a first dimension selection is made. Highest level example, if the user selects Network Name, Series Premier Indicator should be not be able to be selected.

Once the range is set, the user will most likely forget about or think it’s correct and possibly report on incorrect data leading to a whole mess of business mistakes. I’m not sure why the functionality will force it to the inverse…

Hi team, customer said that this is a dealbreaker issue: they are forced to keep their paid analytics offering in Beta because of this.  The repetitive labels make the viz useless. They would classify this as P1.

Hi team, customer said that this is a dealbreaker issue: they are forced to keep their paid analytics offering in Beta because of this. The top left viz is the first and most important viz in the dashboard. For a user viewing the dashboard for the first time, this happens 100% of the time. For repeat viewings, they reckon this occurs about 6 out of 10 times. They would classify this as P1.

Something in the scheduler is broken again for Kounta  ![](https://dv4jgpe7xb4ws.cloudfront.net/v3/unicode/1f62b.png)



If I can get them on a cluster, will that help the issues that keep coming up here?



Seems like there must be a reason for all these issues with them, plus, it's endangering upsell opportunities here.



Would really appreciate someones insight into the technical issues here. Thanks!

Hi,


While trying to send a schedule as PDF, the report fails with an error message ""Error occurred while generating this dashboard - contact administrator (error: Render job 860b9ef123cff405dc0aedc6d93a0dd0[35755] failed [query failed: Cannot subtotal on field sale_and_saleline_cashup.reconciliation_start_day_of_week when it is the rightmost grouped field.])""



It runs fine when scheduled as a pdf. More importantly, if we just run the dashboard (not schedule), it works perfectly fine - which suggests there isnt any issue with the queries



Can you please look into this?



Dashboard: https://looker.kounta.com/dashboards/662



Schedule that failed: 43740



Thanks,

Abhijit

Interesting!  They were acquired by Microsoft.  Do you mean physical location?    Most likely they are in a different location (or at min different network).

fyi - you should try posting this enablement specialist job on San Francisco's www.barefootstudent.com - it is a job site for hiring students and grads.

Molly,



I dont have screenshots since this is On-Prem.. Let me ask Kumaran to provide them.



In any case, if you have Admin privileges on a system that has set up SAML, you should be able to test by manually giving ADMIN role manually and then SUDO'ing as them.

> > On May 14, 2019, Looker determined that this issue occurs when a Native Derived Table (NDT) is relying on access filters from its underlying Explores to filter the data presented to the user.  When a user attribute is selected, changes to the user attribute value may not be reflected in the resulting SQL query for the NDT. In some circumstances, the updated access filter may not be applied, which may result in invalid data being pulled from the cached NDT.  A user must already have appropriate permissions to access the database connection of the underlying explores to access the affected NDT.  If the access filter is applied directly to the LookML of the NDT explore, the filters will be applied to the query and behave as expected.

Any Explores referencing an NDT with applied access_filters should have those same access_filters applied to them.

This changes the sql syntax to a “does not equal” statement and drops the “-” character from the attribute value. Upon execution of the generated SQL statement, incorrect results are rendered to screen since the filter value was not properly parsed by the Looker application. Please note that the user creating the explore must already have access to the model in order to be impacted by the outlined issue.

OK i will get the entire repo to you.  However, i do believe i've copy/pasted enough of the file for you to repro.  Can you make sure you have your druid set to approx count distinct = false please?

PillPack team,



Sorry for the multiple emails today. I wanted to notify you that we will be executing another upsize in Looker hosts tonight between 9-11pm pacific to increase performance. There will be 0 downtime during this upsize - if you have any issue with moving forward with this upsize, please let me know before 9PST.



Best,
Scott

With that being said, your team does have the ability to monitor for when your cluster goes down and comes back up. Once they see it come back up, the maintenance is just about complete (technically this first nod coming back on will be the first indicator and remainder will follow shortly).

RJ and Mike,



You're in good hands with Desiree. She and our ops team are investigating and will get back to you ASAP. However, they are based in California, so won't be fully online until a little later this morning.



In the meantime, could you confirm you completed the IP whitelisting step to allow network traffic to the tunnel server? We've had issues in the past where missing this step can cause permission denied errors when we try to SSH.





Hope to get this resolved soon for you!

Sounds like a plan!  Should anything occur during the upgrade and you require immediate assistance or a roll back, please reach out to **urgent@looker.com**.  They will be the best team to help mitigate any issues.



We can certainly use this thread for a stop notification on or before 5/27.



I will go ahead and have my team schedule your upgrade to 6.10.18 on 5/29 at 10 PM PDT



All the best,

To streamline the upgrade process and make it easier moving forward, would you be open to moving the dev instance to Looker Hosted as well?  This way we can push upgrades there, you can confirm they are healthy and working correctly, then we can upgrade the production instance.

Team,



Any chance we could escalate to get this resolved?  They sent us their 3mo renewal PO approx. 3 weeks ago.  I know you guys were just engaged but they have been trying to install the key upon receiving from our SO team weeks ago.  Greatly appreciate any assistance to give a push to resolve their license key issue!

We'll try to delete groups, it can return a 500 (probably a timeout), but eventually succeeds on the server and the group is deleted. After too many of these timeouts, we'll get a large number of 500 responses almost instantly from Looker. My guess is that the server is overloaded, and is unable to handle any more requests. Please see the example below. At the blue line, you can see that we're deleting a group, that took 100,035 ms. The next line is the same command, but returns within 100ms, and then all the requests below it fail quickly as well. If we sleep the script, Looker seems to recover after a few minutes, and we're able to run again. Increasing the timeout would allow us to get a better realistic view of when it's safe to send the next request and would decrease the amount of ""dead time"" that we have, as we try to not push Looker past an invisible line.

Thanks, all.



Bill,



No worries! Our tech support team here will not be online during that time frame but I'm looking to confirm our Ops team or international counterparts can provide start/end updates.


Stay tuned,
Scott

As Systems Activity is a beta Looker feature, our team suggested that you utilize I_looker as a longterm solution and feel more comfortable giving assurance with i_Looker. I pasted I_looker documentation below, could you review and let me know your thoughts?

The issue is ongoing, but I don't have time to solve it right now.  I'm just querying the database directly in the case that queries exceed the 2 minute mark.


As an FYI, I asked a friend who self-hosts another looker instance if he has encountered this issue, and he said yes.  So maybe it isn't just me.

Whew...to answer your questions



1) Yes It's a shared folder

2) No I'm not using 2FA

4) I have not, I only have 1 account.

Will do, Serena!  I can confirm from our side that the upgrade to 6.10 is planned for 10 pm PDT today.  This will be the latest 6.10 version that has small patches but no substantial changes to the code base from 6.10.18.



Should you need to reach out to our team, they are best reached at support@looker.com.  If it's an emergency please leverage urgent@looker.com



All the best,

Paul

Yes feel free-  you can restart for Sam Vickery. I don't believe I have daily looks scheduled (that I created) but I am on the receiving end of a few.

With that being said, your team does have the ability to monitor for when your cluster goes down and comes back up. Once they see it come back up, the maintenance is just about complete (technically this first nod coming back on will be the first indicator and remainder will follow shortly).

We don't have access to the staging instance currently via our internal 'auth' system (this was stood up after the Prod instance and not added). Can you enable support access on the Prod instance (as we have access to this?). I'm looping in our support team here to assist as I'm on-site again all the day today.



**@Looker support** - Alexis is seeing the host/admin/roles page hanging per the email below on both their self hosted Production (in Looker auth) and Staging (currently Looker do not have access) instances.



i) Can we please investigate this once Alexis has enabled access to the Production instance

ii) Can we please raise a request with Ops to have the PeopleDoc staging instance added to Looker auth?

I had sent a request last week asking about page breaks on dashboard downloads and received a response letting me know about the Labs feature and if it wasn't available we'd need some troubleshooting.



I don't actually have the Labs option (neither does my team). Would you be able to do the troubleshooting required for mine and a few other accounts if I provide emails?



Thanks!

Raj - we were able to run some additional diagnostics with the upgrade from last week, things will hopefully improve substantially with the upgrade tomorrow.



Regardless, we have plenty of improvements that we have uncovered so for in our audit process (aside from those tied directly to performance). I look forward to sharing these with you in person at your offices tomorrow.



Thanks,

Hi Chris,



The error hasn't occurred again yet but we would like to make sure that it doesn't happen again. Can you please give me some more details on the what the network error is so I can take it up with our engineering team?



Thanks,

Hi there,



Our Looker subscription is coming up for renewal and we will not be renewing the tool.



Can you please confirm the last date that we will have access? I believe it is June 30, 2019 but I am not positive. The name on the account is Pilot Fiber, Inc.



Thanks,

On my front things look much much better. I'm able to run queries in i__looker, henry is returning results (though there can sometimes be a wait, but that's ok!), all the tiles in the system activity dashboards are returning.



So from my end I'm unblocked, and I would consider this resolved for now. Thanks for everyone's help!

With that being said, your team does have the ability to monitor for when your cluster goes down and comes back up. Once they see it come back up, the maintenance is just about complete (technically this first nod coming back on will be the first indicator and remainder will follow shortly).

Hi Chris,



I ran the look that you sent in the previous email and it looks like the runtime for some of the queries has been more than 1 minute. It looks like there is a limit of 4 minutes of runtime for scheduled reports. Is this what is causing the issue and if so is there any way of increasing this? I have attached the results of the look for all of the scheduled reports in this email. We have been encountering a separate issue where some of the scheduled looks haven't been uploading to the SFTP even though they show as completed in the Scheduler History. Other reports that are being sent to the same SFTP are uploading without any problem. Is this related to the runtime issue. Only two of the reports (""BlincLoans Transaction Reporting"" and ""BlincLoans Daily Snapshot"") scheduled for today/sent earlier today were successfully uploaded to the SFTP even though all of the reports show as completed (please see the attached screenshot). This causes a big problem on our end as it is not feasible for someone to go check if all the reports were uploaded to the respective folders in the SFTP every day and we are planning on roughly doubling the number of reports that are being sent via Looker.



Thanks,

Kanishk

Scott & Alejandro, hope you’re both well!







I hope you can help. We’re curious what you’re currently seeing at other customers who want to display Looker dashboards on large monitors, “data walls,” etc, in their offices.







We have teams who would like to apply service accounts to this use case (rather than have someone’s regular user account logged in), but the last time we checked with Looker Support, we heard that this isn’t possible with LDAP/SAML enabled.







Are there any options that exist today? If so, could someone on your side connect with our team (cc’d)?







Thanks!







Andy

Hi Katie,




Could you also enable white labeling, I would like to add Drift logo in Login?



Saml:

When we were working on enabling SAML (OKTA) for Looker. We noticed a bug in Looker, thought I would let you know. When we pasted the IdP Metadata and hit load,

The resulting xml generated line breaks which caused errors while testing.



The SAML parser might need a fix for that.



Thanks,

Arun.

Hi Joe –







You’ve misunderstood our issue. I know how to deploy LookML code to our instances. The issue is that the version of looker running on our instances varies from instance to instance. We need to make sure that these four instances are always on the same version so that behavior across them can be relied upon.

 Attached Screenshot shows the various versions. (As does the table in my prior email)

Hi Reed,



Attached is the context switch graph of our host running Looker.

The high peak on May was the day the looker was down.



Why is the peak happening?

Is there a way to avoid the peak, and avoid overall increase in context switch? Below is memory chart, looks quite stable..?

We have had a couple of attempts of upgrading our Looker on-premise implementation (current version 6.2.14), but have hit snags on the way.  I will let them provide details and set up a call with a technical contact over at Looker.  Is there a point person they can contact to get the ball rolling on getting assistance from the Looker team?

 Category : DCL
 Quantity : 1
 Subject : Bug - suggestions query does not use parameter value for sql_table_name
 Account Name or Instance Name : Como - como12.eu.looker.com
 Hosted By : Looker
 Looker Release : 6.12.19
 Severity : (Normal): Software usable but non-critical functionality or system components are affected while most operation is unaffected.
 Summary of Issue : It turns out that Looker does not pass the value from the parameter manually entered to the suggestions query. For example in this setup: view: users { sql_table_name: public.{% parameter manual_table_injection %} ;; parameter: manual_table_injection { type: unquoted } Where in the explore you'll manually type 'users' into parameter called manual_table_injection, any query will work just fine. However, if you'd like to get any suggestions for the string dimensions, they'll fail. That's because these queries will not include the parameter value in the suggestion queries. For example you'll get: SELECT AS ""users.manual_table_injection"" FROM public. AS users WHERE () ILIKE '%' OR () ILIKE '% %' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 LIMIT 1000 ....where you should get: SELECT AS ""users.manual_table_injection"" FROM public. users AS users WHERE () ILIKE '%' OR () ILIKE '% %' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 LIMIT 1000 Note that this will work when we specify the default_value on a parameter but that defeats the purpose. It needs to be dynamic even for suggestions. I've replicated on my local instance. Super easy to replicate. Just should if any questions. Customer will need to keep updated as it's pretty important to them.

 Looker Release : 6.15.0000291
 Severity : (High): Software is operative but performance is seriously degraded or restricted with a significant impact on business operation.
 Summary of Issue : Quick note on Severity: Complete loss of functionality for 1 looker intern who needs access to meta.looker.com... so not sure where that fits in the sev schema. History: Xander was an intern for us last year (2018). When he left, his user was disabled. A few months ago, our team deleted disabled users for meta.looker.com. Current Problem: He onboarded yesterday (6/17/2019) as a returning intern. My understanding of the onboarding process was that everyone is put into the All Lookers AD group first day (or before), and then they can go to meta.looker.com/login and authenticate with Azure. When xander tries to do this, he can successfully authenticate with Azure, and IT and I can confirm we see a successful login event for him in AZURE. This brought me to the looker logs, where I noticed this 2019-06-18 16:54:51.722 +0000 [INFO|1412c|db:looker] :: (0.001675s) SELECT * FROM `credentials_saml` WHERE (`saml_user_id` = 'xander.olivero@looker.com') LIMIT 1 This made me look at the credentials_saml table, where i see this: https://meta.looker.com/sql/kv5nwrn8x4vpsw Note the created_date, logged_in_at and user_id. These are all from when xander was an intern last year, and refer to a user that no longer exists in the users table. I then checked out the users table, where we don't see a record for him, which _is_ expected https://meta.looker.com/sql/ktknqktsm9n8wy I asked in the sme-auth channel, jband had this which lines up with what I'm seeing ""There is probably a stale credentials_saml row that contains the right external saml id (saml_user_id), but has a wrong/dead user_id"" It seems like we aren't cleaning up the credentials_saml table when a user is deleted? In addition to following up with this with eng, If we could take some interim steps to get xander access we'd really appreciate it. Something like this happened to me a couple weeks ago, and Elijah had to manually prune some rows from the content_metadata_group_user table in meta's internal db. If something like that would get xander access that would be sweet. Thanks y'all!

" Putting this back down to high since they are back up.

In the logs, there were a bunch of threads that had been running for a while associated with queries, mainly SQL Runner queries from the looks of it. From the timing script:

```
2019-01-07 07:14:23.791 +0000 => No end time found => (10c55) => 127.0.0.1 |10c54| POST /api/3.1/sql_queries/wjt2hgk5gsgd4b/run/json_fe, {}
```

The weird part is that these queries sent off a request to stream data in another thread:

```
2019-01-07 07:14:24.176 +0000 [INFO|10c55|http_core] :: (0.384712s) |10c54| Request result will stream: 200
```

And that completes just fine:

```
2019-01-07 07:14:24.178 +0000 [INFO|10c54|http_core] :: (0.386339s) Request complete: 200 (End streaming) Streamed 5364 chars.
```

I'm thinking there may be a bug in the timing script not parsing `Request result will stream: 200` correctly as the end of a thread, but need to verify 100% that that is indeed the end of the thread.

Also their memory usage slowly climbed up to the max allocated before the outage, but there were no OOM errors in the logs at all. CPU was fine. Getting access to ilooker would be the best path forward but I might be able to get that info from Pinger if they continue to not respond.

I don't think it's the cause of the outage, but they were also having issues with PDT queues getting longer due to locks on some tables Looker was trying to drop: #188289",Why isn't it working?,
" issue number IC-1458/



Thanks for the fast reply. Few questions just for the clarification.

Did you manage to recreate the behaviour that I described?

You said that an update will fix the visualization length problem. Does that mean that we should update to the latest version? Or do we have to wait for this fix in the next update?

Thanks Eugene, unfortunately, I get this page. Is my URL wrong?



Context:
Someone from the beauty team left the company but she had reports scheduled to other team members still the company. The beauty team would like to know where those reports are, and when the schedule is so they can adjust.



From the BI team’s viewpoint, we think all scheduled reporting should come through the goop-data looker account so that we can avoid a similar future situation where someone leaves and their scheduling reports live in their accounts and the BI team has to go looking for the reports by sudo-ing them.



It would also be good to prevent users from scheduling for their team mates. So people should only be able to schedule reports to themselves, which would be ideal! Or if it is a team wide report then the BI team can handle it and have the management of that schedule centralized.",How do I,

Maxie,
Why that ""CUSTOM FIND CONVO"" does not appear when I search for that expression in github repo?
It doesn't appear in any console.log command
So I assume that the log shows messages that come from slack, and not only from the lookerbot api?
And how is the app structured? For instance, when the program finishes running src/services/service.ts (https://github.com/looker/lookerbot/blob/4fd16c3d4615ca62835c1f40c7ee002e572547a9/src/services/service.ts) , what happens next? I didn't have so much insight reading the package.json and src/index.js
Thank you

Hi Maxie,

We did the deploy by clicking on ""Deploy to Heroku"" button.
Besides, we also attempted to run another app (lookert) on our local server (manual mode) cloning the traditional way, and then using yarn install and yarn start.

There has been few bugs with content validator issues, taking down instances basically. But with no repro case seems like Eng are not taking those seriously. So Ideally pull their Lookml into new master project and hopefully recreate bug.

Hey there,

My name's Marcelo and I'm on the App Directory team here at Slack. I'm getting in touch as 28 days ago we sent you a message informing you that we had detected that your app's support page link was inaccessible. On re-testing it appears that this is still the case. All apps in the App Directory are required to have a valid support page link.

In light of this if this issue is not fixed by Friday the 9th of March we will temporarily delist Looker from the App Directory until such time as the issue has been resolved.

If you have any questions at all about this or are having issues fixing this link let me know.

Marcelo

Slack Support, Feb 6, 2:52 PM PST

Hey there, 

 We hope you're having a great day! We're getting in touch as we have detected the following errors with links associated with your App Directory Listing:

Invalid Support URL: 
URL: https://looker.com/contact 
HTTP Status Code: 404


 Could you take a look at the above issues? If you need to update the URLs associated with your app you can do so here: https://api.slack.com/apps/A1YEFTR25. Once done just resubmit from the 'Update Directory App' section to push those changes to your live app.

If you have any questions let us know, otherwise just reply once all is well.

Thanks,

The App Directory Team

Hey William,

Thanks for the quick response! Yep, the support page should provide people with a clear way to get in touch with you if they have questions about your app. Please note, the support provided must not require the creation of a third party account - an email or contact form is ideal.

Hey Margaret, 

Ah, on looking it appears that the original owner of the app is no longer a member of your workspace which has left the app without an active owner. In this case I have defaulted to making the Primary Owner or your workspace the owner of the app. They can add you as a collaborator to the app by heading to https://api.slack.com/apps/A1YEFTR25/collaborators (while logged into your Slack workspace in the browser). After they do this you should be able to make any edits you need to the app configuration. 

I hope this helps! If you have any questions or issues, let me know.

Thanks,

Marcelo

"# Summary

Julie came on chat asking about a few queries that took longer to run than usual (~60 seconds per query vs normal 4). These queries are asccoiated with dashboard 58 and the notable [spikes](https://looker-us.merrillcorp.com/explore/system__activity/history?qid=GZY3gNJSwGoCRlVkWee8n0&toggle=dat,vis) occurred at 11:01 and 11:05 UTC on [6/3](https://looker-us.merrillcorp.com/explore/system__activity/history?qid=qvBUbRivgAXMUhYPwukA5X&toggle=vis) and 9:02, 10:27, and 12:04 UTC on [6/8](https://looker-us.merrillcorp.com/explore/system__activity/history?qid=Me0vg3fd5xMW5CuJVjVjMb&toggle=vis).

### Other Findings
- The [Dashboard Performance](https://looker-us.merrillcorp.com/explore/system__activity/dashboard_performance?qid=cAWf7H5nUogpiuXka9VayE) system activity explore is showing some very high numbers for the ""seconds until"" fields for some dashboard runs on the 8th, though these queries are showing up as having run in a matter of seconds and the logs don't seem indicate anything suspicious about these queries.

- I also found a [bug](https://looker.atlassian.net/browse/IC-2016) that's coming up when this dashboard is run, showing `Rack app error: #<ArgumentError: invalid %-encoding` errors in the logs but I've found no indication that this is related. 

- The `query_summary` lines for the long running queries (pasted below) show everything but the SQL running quickly. 

- Something makes me think this is related to the filter values, however I have nothing to back up that theory.",Bug,

> Customer is having issues getting suggestions to generate in a dashboard filter. First he was using a parameter as the field to suggest filters. This wasn't generating anything. He changed the suggestion to a dimension instead, this generated an ""other"" suggestion. The issue now is that this isn't the only suggestion that should appear. I had  Daniel check on the filter suggestions for that dimension directly in an explore and that generated the correct list. Lastly, Daniel searched for the suggestion query in i__looker to find the query and tested in sql runner and the query produced the expected results. My thoughts are that this query might not necessarily be associated with the dashboard ad could be from the suggestions in the explore. Also, settings in the dashboard filter look correct. Type is field. Dimension type is a string.

I was able to run this dashboard when sudoed as Vishal Daga
and also was able to sent test schedule to my own email, as PDF and inline vis. Both received no errors.
Also vishal.daga has been firing tons of queries within 1 hour. Screenshot attached.

https://honestbee.jp.looker.com/explore/i__looker/history?qid=qiJGoccW2wHdvGeiiAVTg2&toggle=dat,vis

Since we can only render two things at the same time (by default) two slow queries can back everything else up. So [the image download] jobs really are queued for rendering.

--scheduler-query-limit=<i> Limits number of concurrent scheduled queries
(default: 10)
--scheduler-query-timeout=<i> Length of scheduler timeout to wait for
connection (default: 1200)

Also render timeouts are 30 minutes and I don't think we can change those.

Since we host, only we can do a reboot of the system.

I also could not see any active schedules for Vishal Daga, however I was able to see few failed schedules for him with the error message stating that dashboard failed to render.

Error occurred while generating this dashboard - contact administrator (error: Render job 13daba46b28f96b06b878dd7281fe60c[56042] failed [Looker::Render::RendererTimeout])
this dash

So they way it works in Looker.
1. queries got fired against your DB
2. once they return it begins renderring 
3. If it fails to render within 30 minutes it will fail

Cannot download log for 23.07 looks like size is the problem, tried to copy and compress it via keybox, but filed to download too. I am stuck to move forward with it.

they are claiming queries timing out/schedules fail. This has being going for some time, so probably not critical.

> *Enter the business impact of the problem*

> *Enter the what you'd like the next shift to do*

I think it's pretty straight forward what is wrong, they are hitting those limits. There is far more to it. There has been convo in #cs-honestbee , so looks like they are moving away from Redshift towards Snowflake, due to Redshift is not able to handle their load. But we are trying to get them into working state while they have not moved (edited)

I am not 100% this will help them in the long run, if they continue to do crazy things

I am lost at how to communicate to them, that they cannot have single user to  run 3000  queries in under an hour
without creating bottleneck.

So what I think really needs to be done is to have someone with good Redshift knowledge to explain all those limits to them, so they can spread their load somehow without hitting those concurrency issues. Also, get second knowledgeable opinion on whether tweaking those settings in llookerstart.cfg should be done and whether it will help at all.

Bord Gais came up on chat, they had these issues:

-  Refresh is very slow to the point of failure.
- They are unable to deploy any changes to git (They can't push to remote). They use Bitbucket.
- They cannot access to the chat functionality, or if they manage to access, they get disconnected.

So we had a brief communication on chat with the client and this seems to me a connectivity issue in their server. They have been asked to check some stuff, see below, but they haven't come back with the info yet (it seems they struggle with technicalities), only forwarded the logs from a week ago, as they aren't writing today's (!):

```-rw-r--r-- 1 looker looker 0 Aug 12 00:00 looker.log```

He is going to come back to us on this but was worried about the performance issues that might have that extra check query_task_info call (we told them that will prevent the 404 that he is now getting and is necessary).

**How is this affecting the client?**

Customer has a release on 2/15, and they need the cache to be working for this, to demonstrate that their workflow is performant


**Where are we going?**

Let's keep sending this one back and forward until they get it done. Mohammed (main developer) is going to try the new approach and inform us. It would be good to also figure the performance implications (maybe Eng can assist) that this solution might have vs the run_inline_query that he was previously using, as he might ask.

**What's been covered so far?**

We've been taking a look during EMEA time and have identified that the ticket needs to go to **Eng**, to get better troubleshooting and some directions.

I agree with Vince on this one. This is very likely to be an issue with Chromium taking an snapshot of the dashboard before actually finishing to render. 

The issue seems to be intermittent as I've been doing some testing on these particular dashboard:

https://supergroup.eu.looker.com/dashboards/1561 ( the one that generated the failed PDF above on the 11/11th)

.. trying to render it, while fetching results (from both DB and cache) and it has worked just fine on both ways: Downloading and Scheduling as a PDF. 

Regarding logs, I believe I managed to narrow down the renderer job to that applied to that particular dashboard:

```
2018-11-11 12:06:21.732 +0000 [INFO|0085c|event:render] :: render_job by user 24:, target='dashboards', target_id='1561', type='wysiwyg_dashboard', format='pdf', status='success', runtime='37.701304', caching_runtime='27.702290058135986', phantom_runtime='9.172364711761475', renderer_name='chromium rendering'
```

But I am not sure how can I interpret this information, or if it is even meaningful (seems successful) .

I am adding here a log file with all the renderer jobs on every node of the cluster (`grep 'renderer'`), might be worth to take a further look.

Just checked the code briefly in Github to see where the error was being thrown, but thought that the unlimited download was coming from the UI with -1 download limit. Customer points out that this also happened outside the UI.

Next thing to check is whether they have unlimited downloads set as per Guru:

>API as per slack: 100,000 row limit unless the caller (user) has unlimited downloads permission. Note that queries created with the UI will typically contain the UI’s 5000 row limit expressed in the query limit field. That’s the limit you’ll get when running that query from the API unless you specify a different limit on the API call.

Nick is concerned about an episode last weekend where he feels that the data shown in Looker was nearly a day out of date. Unfortunately the details are not exactly clear (he cannot name a specific tile to investigate, for example) as it was reported to him by users.  The initial message was:
>I'm seeing our looker instance show data that is out of sync with our Redshift data warehouse. Our warehouse is showing data that is within 20 minutes of our production data (which is our planned schedule). However, when I query the same data from our existing looker dashboards it is showing that the data is almost 20 hours out of date.

I asked him to clarify how he checked that the data was out of date when he initially investigated the situation, and he detailed:

>1. In the looker dashboards I selected explore from here on the daily sales tile and then chose to clear cache and refresh to ensure that I was getting recent data. Doing this did not update the sales data and I was able to see we were not receiving orders for Saturday this way. 
2. I was able to see that the data was out of date by manually selecting recent orders in a separate explore. Orders stopped at 2 AM UTC even though it was around 11 PM UTC when I ran that query to list orders. 
3. I then checked tables in the warehouse directly using the SQL Runner (I shared those in the last email) to verify that the ETL job was updating data properly. The sql runner results were directly contradicting the dashboards and explores I had previously run.


**Ticket Priority:** 

## Low

**What's been covered so far?**

I've tried to check if the issue was related to caching, PDTs, datagroups etc. I've had to choose a particular tile to look at, as there are dozens of them and investigating all would take forever. As far as I can see, there is only one PDT involved, dim_calendar, which increments daily. I don't see any datagroups involved in the explore the tile is based on, but the tile has a persist_for of 30 minutes.

__I based my checks on one tile at the top left of the dashboard, Daily Gross Sales__

__The Explore has a 30 minute persist_for:__

explore: trans_date {
  from: dim_calendar
  label: ""Transactional Date""
  hidden: no
  persist_for: ""30 minutes"" ----> __persist_for enables you to modify the amount of time that cached query results are used__ 

__dim_calendar is a derived table, with a SQL_Trigger_Value based on the current date:__

view: dim_calendar {
  derived_table: {
    sql:
    SELECT
      *,
      TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('month', date ), 'YYYY-MM') AS ""calendar_month""
    FROM
      public.dim_calendar
    where
      date >= '2015-01-01'
      and date <= getdate()+interval '30 day';;
    __sql_trigger_value: SELECT CURRENT_DATE__ ;;
    distribution_style: all
    sortkeys: [""date""]
  }
 

**How is this affecting the client?**

>Our management is very concerned about data reliability in looker.

**Where are we going?**

I'm on leave for the next 10 days or so, but I'm not happy that I've investigated all the possible causes of this issue. I'd like someone to verify what I have found (i.e. nothing!) and see if I missed anything.

**Anything else we should be aware of?**

Because this was reported to Nick, I do have doubts whether there is actually anything going on at all that is out of the ordinary. Dashboard auto-refresh is not turned on, so the dashboard could have been run 20 hours before the user saw it, and they thought everything was out of date. However, Nick says 'clear cache and refresh' didn't update the data, and he could see that the updated data was available via SQL Runner, so....?

"# Summary so far by: _Noah_
Alright, so this ticket began with you guys (Amina) in Dublin and carried over. A lot of stuff went down with these guys over the course of the day so I'll break it up based on subject. Overall theme here is that these guys don't quite know too much about their own Looker set up because apparently they outsourced their development of SSO Embedding to third party consulting companies or something. The CS team doesn't seem to know what they are doing as well because of them outsourcing all of this work. Nor do they really understand the basic architecture of Looker. So it took a long time to really get to what was wrong (and I still dont _really_ know to be honest.

From Amina's ticket we thought the issue was an API call not finding a schedule. This was resolved in our point of view. The get schedules endpoint returns schedules **owned** by the user calling this endpoint. They were calling a get schedule and getting blank results, because the user didnt own any schedules. This schedule they though they should have been getting doesn't exist, either it was deleted or was never created. i__looker queries in this chat. 

Next stuff comes from this ticket: #192964

They kept mentioning how their schedule wouldn't show up in their third party app, and I was super confused about this. So I asked a couple times if they could send me the api call/sdk or any code that dictated whether we were talking about the API or embedding, because I was hoping I'd see either an iframe or some SDK call like sdk.get... Turns out this was SSO Embedding and they're dashboards are not rendering in their other website. This is the example URL they gave me to check out:

```
convirzadev.looker.com/login/embed/%2Fembed%2Fdashboards%2F258%3Fembed_domain%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Flocal.convirza.com%26?nonce=%22UFibgsSKJkkLawrj%22&time=1548798352&session_length=86400&external_user_id=2&permissions=%5B%22see_user_dashboards%22%2C%22see_lookml_dashboards%22%2C%22access_data%22%2C%22see_looks%22%2C%22see_drill_overlay%22%2C%22schedule_look_emails%22%2C%22schedule_external_look_emails%22%2C%22download_with_limit%22%2C%22download_without_limit%22%2C%22save_content%22%5D&models=%5B%22cfa_reports_model%22%2C%22convirza_model%22%5D&access_filters=%7B%7D&first_name=%22Bill%22&last_name=%22Joe%22&group_ids=%5B%5D&external_group_id=%22awesome_engineers%22&user_attributes=%7B%22host_name%22%3A%22local.convirza.com%22%2C%22api_url%22%3A%22localhost%22%2C%22ct_user_id%22%3A2%2C%22access_token%22%3A%22%20a690fe64-7060-444a-ad8b-990a822969d9%22%2C%22role_id%22%3A1%7D&force_logout_login=true&user_timezone=%22America%2FDenver%22&signature=hxUuaVtyhDmFf5Ajz1pKKYdTydg%3D 
```

So checking out this dashboard 258 in the **dev** instance and all the schedules built off of it is the next step in the epic journey. Be very careful when chatting with them, I think they were opening chats in one instance and asking questions about stuff in the other instance, which is why it took so long to realize stuff. So very clearly ask about dev vs prod instance for everything. They're colleagues Rahul and Ajay _should_ know more about their third party app thats embedding stuff. Its pretty difficult to get answers out of Sanket though.

Also perhaps there is something in the logs for us too.
As this is a 502, i'm thinking perhaps extra layers are causing this? (proxy?)

Our repo on the Lookerbot supports a Heroku (one-click) deployment. (https://github.com/looker/lookerbot)
This installation on Ubuntu is custom and we would not be able to support this well.

We can however give some high level guidance for them; 
they get error msg _Could not connect to the Slack API. Ensure your Slack API key is correct_ so can they confirm the key is correct?
A line in the output throws: `http://MY_HOST:3333/slack/receive` as the host, is this a valid host?
Is that host, the host that generated the Slack API key?

For more comprehensive help on this, they can file an issue on the public repo so that our engineers can see their questions with this settup: https://github.com/looker/lookerbot/issues

Oh no!

Looks like they are [no longer on No Update](https://meta.looker.com/explore/meta/check?qid=VBTf26qB4II0v1Is649pT8&origin_space=103&toggle=pik), but there's no note indicating why that might have happened. Based on [their update dates](https://meta.looker.com/explore/meta/check?qid=VBTf26qB4II0v1Is649pT8&origin_space=103&toggle=pik), it seems possible that it never stuck. I'll see if we can audit what happened in the License server.

Rolling their instance back would require going to a backup on Looker 5.2 or before, so they'd lose all non-LookML work done since 12/13 (users created, Looks, Dashboards, etc.). 

I'll move this information to the ticket so whomever grabs it can see it.

Hi Carter, Hilary, 

Hope you both had a nice weekend! 

NexRep submitted a ticket this morning (#120844) because they're experiencing a number of LookML errors. 

We moved them to the 'no update list' in December but it looks like they were upgraded to version 5.4.13.

Is it possible to roll them back to their prior version?

Thank you!

"## HST Summary 

- Business Impact: Update to 5.14.6 caused > 1000 LookML errors to be thrown because of improper use of ${} syntax in DTs, despite the fix to replace errors with warnings. All queries were failing to run due to these errors. 

- What have we done: Rolled back 5.12, which has resolved errors. Fix being backported to 5.14. 

- Where are we going: Rollback working well for today, customer will be re-updated to 5.14 during next maintenance hours. 

- Best bet ETA: Solved",Bug,

Hey Moritz,

This is Spencer from Looker support regarding the domain name change for the judopay.eu.looker.com instance.

Angaza Engineering, Apr 10, 22:42 EAT

Hi Clarice,

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. After investigating this issue, we discovered that the database that we use to perform our exports to your Redshift cluster fell out of sync for approximately 20 minutes on Mar 12 from 1820h until 1840h, which also corresponded with our export to GLP Uganda's payments table.

There were 85 total payments that were not reflecting in GLP's Uganda Redshift payments table. I've attached a list of the payment's Angaza IDs, but let me know if you'd like additional data on the payments.

I've manually exported these payments, so they are now present in your Redshift cluster.

As part of this investigation, we'll put steps in place to detect future synchronization problems to ensure this problem won't happen again in the future.

Thanks,

Bill | Angaza Engineering

Mark Brian, Apr 10, 17:16 EAT

Hey Clarice,

Kindly share with us the Account numbers as opposed to the Angaza ID, this way we are better placed to assist.

It would also be important for you to share with us the following information for better tracing of the payments:

1. Phone number that made the payment
2. The amount
3. The Transaction ID for the payments

Awaiting your response.

Thank you.

Hi angaza,

We've come across  2 accounts (AC994717, AC994697) whose deposit payments are not reflecting in the payments table in redshift.

This is affecting repayment performance of agents who made these sales and also the customers maybe followed up unnecessarily to make payments.

Please look into this and also let us know if anything specific could have happened that led to the issue and also if there are any other accounts which are affected.

Thanks

Clarice Maloba, Apr 11, 16:01 EAT

Thanks Bill.

The transaction IDs are enough. I've confirmed the payments are ok now.

Angaza Engineering, Apr 10, 22:42 EAT

Hi Clarice,

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. After investigating this issue, we discovered that the database that we use to perform our exports to your Redshift cluster fell out of sync for approximately 20 minutes on Mar 12 from 1820h until 1840h, which also corresponded with our export to GLP Uganda's payments table.

There were 85 total payments that were not reflecting in GLP's Uganda Redshift payments table. I've attached a list of the payment's Angaza IDs, but let me know if you'd like additional data on the payments.

I've manually exported these payments, so they are now present in your Redshift cluster.

As part of this investigation, we'll put steps in place to detect future synchronization problems to ensure this problem won't happen again in the future.

Thanks,

Bill | Angaza Engineering

Hey Clarice,

Kindly share with us the Account numbers as opposed to the Angaza ID, this way we are better placed to assist.

It would also be important for you to share with us the following information for better tracing of the payments:

1. Phone number that made the payment
2. The amount
3. The Transaction ID for the payments

Awaiting your response.

Thank you.

Hi angaza,

We've come across  2 accounts (AC994717, AC994697) whose deposit payments are not reflecting in the payments table in redshift.

This is affecting repayment performance of agents who made these sales and also the customers maybe followed up unnecessarily to make payments.

Please look into this and also let us know if anything specific could have happened that led to the issue and also if there are any other accounts which are affected.

Thanks

谢谢，

Hi Tracy,

Can you verify what system you are trying to access? It looks like you were emailing Looker support, where you do not have an active account at this time. You do have an account for our Workbench tool; however, it looks as though the password has expired. Please let me know which system you are trying to access.

Hey Cindy and Peggy,

Thanks for sharing and happy to help!

I just want to preface that my level of access and troubleshooting is limited compared to our Engineers, so apologies if there's any gaps in time between myself to you two and me conversing with our Engineers. I took a look at your chat transcript and if it helps to clarify, our RedShift is a multi-tenant data warehouse where the client data is separated by schemas. We provided Compass their respective credentials to access their schema.

Regarding your error, I'm connecting with our Engineers some more to help test some theories. Unfortunately, I'm not technically suited to troubleshoot this on my own, but I'll be sure to follow-up as soon as I have further updates! Appreciate you looking into it and sharing with us your logs, Peggy! I'm also running that by our team to dig into.

Thanks again for your insight and talk to you soon!

Best,
Thai

Hi All,

Hope this finds you well! I just concluded my meeting with our engineer, Josh, who is helping to dig into this further. Upon investigating, we had some potential solutions that we were hoping Peggy could help to confirm whether it'd be possible or not.


-

Is disabling prepared statements a supported feature in Looker?

-

Is editing the jdbc string directly to add prepareThreshold=0 possible? This would help to disable the prepared statements. I know you had mentioned this in your chat, but this is an option we'd like to explore as well.


Thanks again and looking forward to your response!
